# Section 12: Cloud Monitoring

# Amazon CloudWatch Metrics

- CloudWatch provides metrics for *****every***** service in AWS
- A metric is a variable to monitor (CPU Utilization, NetworkIn…)
- Metrics have timestamps
- Can create CloudWatch dashboards of metrics

# Important Metrics

- EC2 Instances: CPU Utilization, Status Checks, Network (not RAM)
    - Default metrics every 5 minutes
    - Option for Detailed Monitoring ($$$): metrics every 1 minute
- EBS volumes: Disk Read/Writes
- S3 Buckets: BucketSizeBytes, NumberOfObjects, AllRequests
- Billing: Total Estimated Charge (only in us-east-1)
- Service Limits: how much you’ve been using a service API
- Custom Metrics: push your own metrics

# Amazon CloudWatch Alarms

- Alarms are used to trigger notifications for any metric
- Alarms actions…
    - Auto Scaling: increase or decrease EC2 instances “desired” count
    - EC2 Actions: stop, terminate, reboot, or recover an EC2 instance
    - SNS Notifications: send a notification into an SNS topic
- Various options (sampling, %, max., min., etc…)
- Can choose the period on which to evaluate an alarm
- Example: create a **billing alarm** on the CloudWatch Billing metric
- Alarm States: OK, INSUFFICIENT_DATA, ALARM

# Amazon CloudWatch Logs

- CloudWatch Logs can collect logs from:
    - Elastic Beanstalk: collection of logs from the application
    - ECS: collection from containers
    - AWS Lambda: collection from function logs
    - CloudTrail based on filter
    - CloudWatch log agents: on EC2 machines or on-premises servers
    - Route53: Log DNS queries
- Enables ****************************************real-time monitoring**************************************** of logs
- Adjustable CloudWatch Logs retention

# CloudWatch Logs for EC2

- By default, no logs from your EC2 instance will go to CloudWatch

- You need to run a CloudWatch agent on EC2 to push the log files you want
- Make sure that IAM permissions are correct
- The CloudWatch log agent can be setup on-premises too

# Amazon EventBridge (formerly CloudWatch Events)

- Schedule: CRON Jobs (scheduled scripts)

- Event Pattern: Event rules to react to a service doing something

- Trigger Lambda functions, send SQS/SNS messages…
- EventBridge is the next evolution of CloudWatch Events
- Default event bus: generated by AWS services (EC2, Lambda, S3)
- Partner event bus: receive events from SaaS services or applications (Zendesk, DataDog, Segment, Auth0…)
- Custom Event buses: for your own applications
- Schema Registry: model event schema
- You can archive events (all/filter) sent to an event bus (indefinitely or set period)
- Ability to replay archived events

# AWS CloudTrail

- Provides governance, compliance, and audit for your AWS account
- CloudTrail is enabled by default
- Get a history of events/API calls made within your AWS account by:
    - Console
    - SDK
    - CLI
    - AWS Services
- Can put logs from CloudTrail into CloudWatch Logs or S3
- A trail can be applied to All Regions (Default) or a single Region
- If a resource is deleted in AWS, investigate CloudTrail first

# AWS X-Ray

- Debugging in Production, the old way:
    - Test locally
    - Add log statements everywhere
    - Re-deploy in production
- Log formats differ across applications and log analysis is hard
- Debugging: one big monolith “easy”, distributed services “hard”
- No common views of your entire architecture

# AWS X-Ray Advantages

- Troubleshooting performance (bottlenecks)
- Understand dependencies in a microservice architecture
- Pinpoint service issues
- Review request behavior
- Find errors and exceptions
- Identify users that are impacted

# Amazon CodeGuru

- An ML-powered service for automated code reviews and application performance recommendations
- Provides two functionalities
    - CodeGuru Reviewer: automated code reviews for static code analysis (development)
    - CodeGuru Profiler: visibility/recommendations about application performance during runtime (production)

# Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer

- Identify critical issues, security vulnerabilities, and hard-to-find bugs
- Example: common coding best practices, resource leaks, security detection, input validation
- Uses Machine Learning and automated reasoning
- Hard-learned lessons across millions of code reviews on 1000s of open-source and Amazon repositories
- Supports Java and Python
- Integrates with GitHub, Bitbucket, and AWS CodeCommit

# Amazon CodeGuru Profiler

- Helps understand the runtime behavior of your application
- Example: identify if your application is consuming excessive CPU capacity on a logging routine
- Features:
    - Identify and remove code inefficiencies
    - Improve application performance (e.g., reduce CPU utilization)
    - Decrease compute costs
    - Provides heap summary (identify which objects using up memory)
    - Anomaly Detection
- Support applications running on AWS or on-premise
- Minimal overhead on application

# AWS Health Dashboard - Service History

- Shows all regions, all services health
- Shows historical information for each day
- Has an RSS feed you can subscribe to
- Previously called AWS Service Health Dashboard

# AWS Health Dashboard - Your Account

- Previously called AWS Personal Health Dashboard
- AWS Account Health Dashboard provides alerts and remediation guidance when AWS is experiencing events that may impact you
- While the Service Health Dashboard displays the general status status of AWS services, Account Health Dashboard gives you a personalized view of the performance and availability of the AWS services underlying your AWS resources
- The dashboard displays relevant and timely information to help you manage events in progress and provides proactive notification to help you plan for scheduled activities
- Can aggregate data from an entire AWS Organization
- Global service
- Shows how AWS outages directly impact you & your AWS resources
- Alert, remediation, proactive, scheduled activities
